# Cloud-Architecture-Case-Study
A case study in which a sample network topology and corresponding documentation must be created for a small and medium size company. Prepared as part of the coursework for ISDS 4130

This course was one of my favorites, and I took a lot of effort and pride in creating this case.

Below can be seen sample diagrams of network topologies.
